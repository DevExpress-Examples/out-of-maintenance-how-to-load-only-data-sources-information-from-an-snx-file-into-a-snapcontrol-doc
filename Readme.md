# How to load only Data Sources information from an SNX file into a SnapControl document

> **Note**
>
> As you may already know, the [WinForms Snap control](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/11373/controls-and-libraries/snap) and [Snap Report API](https://docs.devexpress.com/OfficeFileAPI/15188/snap-report-api) are now in maintenance support mode. No new features or capabilities are incorporated into these products. We recommend that you use [DevExpress Reporting](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/2162/reporting) tool to generate, edit, print, and export your business reports/documents.

<p>The main idea of the demonstrated approach is to load a corresponding SNX template into a temporary SnapDocumentServer instanceÂ and copy items from theÂ <strong>SnapDocumentServer.Document.DataSources</strong>Â collection into a current SnapControl document.<br />InÂ this sample, data sources are loaded from two templates: "<strong>nwindDataSourceTemplate.snx</strong>" andÂ "<strong>carsDataBaseTemplate.snx</strong>".<br />In the attachment you can find a video which demonstrates how these templates were created.<br />Please take special note that the use of theÂ <strong>SnapDocumentServer</strong>Â instance in an application requires adding a reference to theÂ <strong>DevExpress.Docs</strong>Â assembly. This assembly isÂ shipped only with theÂ <strong>Universal</strong>Â subscription or with a separateÂ <strong>Document ServerÂ </strong>subscription:<br /><a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Subscriptions/">https://www.devexpress.com/Subscriptions/</a></p>
